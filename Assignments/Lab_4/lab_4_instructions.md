# Lab 4 Instructions

In lab 2 we created 4 functions. Those functions did not have any interfaces. Create a web page that acts as an interface and self posts the results back to the page.  To complete this lab, you will need the following functions.

`isset()` -> Determine if a variable is set and is not NULL. [`isset()` API Documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php)

`empty()` -> Determine whether a variable is considered to be empty. A variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals FALSE. empty() does not generate a warning if the variable does not exist. [`empty()` API Documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php)

You will also need the following SUPER GLOBAL array.

`$_POST[]` -> An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method. [`$_POST[]` API Documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php)

You will also need to remember how to build an HTML form. [W3C `Form` API Documentation](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html).

Make sure that you complete the PHPDoc documentation for this assignment.
